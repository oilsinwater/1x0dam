## Core Vision

### What We Believe

We believe surveillance capitalism is a threat to the future of digital rights, climate justice, healthcare, and all issues that rely on modern communication technology to achieve societal progress. This extractive system—which now operates as the online sphere's dominant organizing principle—must be changed.

We believe one of the best ways to catalyze this critical change is to enter the machine and experiment with its tools in order to expose the harms it is inflicting across all populations.

We believe an essential part of doing this work is to always seek out opportunities to reduce these harms—be it through our own work or via openly sharing our findings with policymakers and activists alike.

We believe all such efforts of entering the machine must be guided by ethical constraints and buttressed by transparency.

We believe that, in the obvious abdication of responsibility and absence of sufficient action by others, the time for us to act is now.

### Problem Statement

Surveillance capitalism—the commodification of personal data and algorithmic exploitation—operates as the online sphere's dominant organizing principle, inflicting an astonishing list of growing harms across all populations. Yet advocates, policymakers, and litigators lack a credible, centralized evidence repository to document these harms and build cohesive cases for comprehensive global policy reform. Existing research is scattered, making it difficult to break the vicious cycle through regulatory action or litigation.

### Problem Impact

This extractive system—operating with egregious lack of government oversight—has resulted in:

- **Rampant mis- and disinformation** spread through algorithmically-controlled ranking and recommendation systems designed to exploit, not empower.
- **Political advertising abuse** and discriminatory advertising targeting vulnerable populations.
- **Discriminatory content moderation** and corresponding lack of non-English moderation.
- **Extreme and harmful content promotion** via algorithmic systems optimizing for engagement over safety.
- **Fragmented evidence base:** Critical research documenting these harms is scattered across platforms with inconsistent standards, making it hard for professionals to build cohesive cases for reform.
- **Share friction:** Professionals hesitate to circulate research that lacks methodological transparency or institutional legitimacy—limiting evidence circulation in critical networks.

### Proposed Solution

Establish "Mayday," a professional research publication that enters the machine and experiments with the tools of surveillance capitalism to expose the harms inflicting populations worldwide. Modeled after Bellingcat and guided by ethical constraints and transparency, Mayday delivers rigorous investigations through a centralized, credible repository—providing advocates, policymakers, and litigators with evidence designed to spur policy reform, speed the end of this extractive system, and break the vicious cycle via comprehensive global policy reform.

### Key Differentiators

- **Enters the machine:** Uses the tools of surveillance capitalism itself to expose systemic harms—experimenting with platforms' own mechanisms to document algorithmic exploitation, discriminatory systems, and extractive practices.
- **Ethical constraints and transparency:** Every investigation foregrounds research methods, data sources, and editorial standards—guided by ethics while openly sharing findings with policymakers and activists to reduce harms.
- **Targets comprehensive reform:** Research explicitly designed to catalyze policy change and break the vicious cycle via global regulatory action—not just document problems.
- **PDF evidence packages:** Downloadable reports enable offline use in legal filings, policy briefs, and coalition communications.
- **Professional presentation:** Site design signals institutional legitimacy, making it share-friendly in risk-averse professional networks while maintaining activist mission.

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

In the obvious abdication of responsibility and absence of sufficient action by others, existing channels fail to catalyze the critical change needed:

- **Academic journals** are paywalled, slow to publish, and inaccessible to practitioners who need timely evidence for regulatory action.
- **Advocacy blogs** vary widely in quality and methodological rigor, making policymakers hesitant to cite them in official proceedings.
- **Commercial publishing platforms** lack both institutional credibility and the explicit mission to spur comprehensive policy reform.
- **Fragmented research** scatters evidence across disconnected sites, making it impossible to build the cohesive case needed to break the vicious cycle.
- **Existing efforts lack urgency:** The time to act is now, yet most research institutions operate on academic timelines incompatible with the accelerating harms of surveillance capitalism.

## Market Context

Living in a quantified society augmented by big data and machine intelligence provides an opportunity for positive change:

- **Surveillance capitalism is a threat to the future** of digital rights, climate justice, healthcare, and all issues that rely on modern communication technology to achieve societal progress—creating urgent demand for evidence to catalyze reform.
- **EU regulatory momentum:** DSA enforcement, DMA implementation, and AI Act rollout create openings for comprehensive global policy reform if provided with credible evidence.
- **Litigation surge:** Tech accountability lawsuits (GDPR violations, algorithmic discrimination, consumer protection) require rigorous evidence packages documenting systemic harms.
- **The time to act is now:** In the obvious abdication of responsibility by tech platforms and absence of sufficient government action, civil society must enter the machine to expose harms and spur change.
- **EU-first opportunity:** European policy networks (EURACTIV, EDRI, regulatory bodies) are more receptive to evidence-based research targeting comprehensive reform.
- **Bellingcat model validation:** Bellingcat's success demonstrates that transparent methodology + rigorous research can build institutional legitimacy while maintaining activist mission.

## Technical Preferences

### Current State
- **Existing setup:** Sanity CMS with defined schemas but minimal data; Next.js frontend (web/).
- **Migration path:** Evaluate porting Sanity schemas to Strapi via YAML or domain-specific language—architect to determine schema translation strategy.

### Target Architecture

- **Front end:** Astro static site (minimal client JS) for fast, accessible, professional presentation; MDX disabled unless essential.
- **Design system:** ShadCN or Radix UI components for consistent, accessible UI—evaluate how far existing designs can be implemented with these systems.
- **CMS/API:** Strapi self-hosted with Postgres + Redis for editorial workflow and content management.

### Critical UI Features

- **Footnotes system (high priority):**
  - Rich footnotes with multiple qualities/attributes
  - Right-hand column display for persistent visibility
  - Different footnote types that float next to referencing content blocks
  - Hyperlinked references between content and footnotes
  - Architect must design flexible footnote architecture supporting these patterns

### Visual Storytelling

- **High-quality graphics:** Investigation illustrations, evidence visualization, branding elements
- **Motion/animation:** Subtle UI animations, scrollytelling effects where appropriate
- **Charts and data visualization:** Interactive/static charts for conveying investigative findings

### Deployment & Resilience

- **Decentralized publishing:** Fleek or similar for IPFS-based deployment—built for resilience and censorship resistance
- **Seeding strategy:** Investigations automatically seeded to decentralized storage upon publication
- **Anonymity layer:** Deployment pipeline should obscure hosting metadata while maintaining professional accessibility (not overtly "crypto" but structurally resilient)
- **PDF generation:** Automated pipeline to generate professionally-formatted evidence packages from published investigations

### Tooling

- GitHub repo for version control, Ky for API fetches, restic for encrypted backups

## Organizational Context

- Civil society research collective committed to using the tools of surveillance capitalism to expose harms, spur policy reform, and speed the end of this extractive, exploitative, and dehumanizing system.
- Distributed team across EU and US time zones, with editorial workflows coordinated via Strapi CMS.
- **Guided by ethical constraints and buttressed by transparency:** All efforts of entering the machine must foreground methodology, source documentation, and editorial standards to build trust while maintaining activist mission.
- **Always seeking to reduce harms:** Research explicitly designed to openly share findings with policymakers and activists to catalyze comprehensive reform—not just document problems.
- **Quality control:** Editorial review process ensures investigations meet both professional rigor standards and mission alignment before publication.

---

## Risks and Assumptions

- **Credibility building:** Policymakers/litigators must trust output from a new research collective; plan assumes consistent quality and transparent methodology will build legitimacy over time (Bellingcat model validates this approach).
- **EU-first assumption:** Strategy presumes EU policy networks will be more receptive early adopters than US counterparts; if EU traction is slow, may need to pivot.
- **Share adoption:** Success depends on target users feeling comfortable forwarding links to colleagues; if platform appears too "edgy" or activist-oriented, professional adoption will stall.
- **PDF workflow:** Assumes automated PDF generation can meet professional formatting standards; manual formatting fallback may be needed initially.
- **Resource constraints:** Small editorial team must balance investigation quality with publication velocity; risk of bottlenecks if review process is too rigorous.

## Timeline (MVP ≈ 2 Months)

- **Weeks 1-2:** Stand up Strapi + Astro pipeline; design investigation templates with methodology sections; develop professional site styling (Tailwind).
- **Weeks 3-4:** Build PDF generation pipeline; create content types for investigations, evidence documentation, and methodology pages.
- **Weeks 5-6:** Pilot editorial workflow with 1-2 investigations; refine templates based on professional use feedback; test share-friendliness with target users.
- **Weeks 7-8:** Publish first 2-3 investigations; seed distribution via EU policy networks; capture initial citation/share metrics; iterate based on professional audience feedback.
