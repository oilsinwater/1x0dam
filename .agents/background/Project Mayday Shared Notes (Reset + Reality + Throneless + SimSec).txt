Shared drive -- docs from Signal dumped in here 

July 30, 2021 - Check-in and planning 
Here: Ame, Georgia, Katie, Debra, Dan, Nick, Harum 

Agenda: 
Goals:
Roles and responsibilities 
Decide where to start
Scratch doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b6JQ9QvxW8MDO5tbX83Ws0wIDgwj0GjxDT13Fv6VQJM/edit# 
Don’t feel beholden to this, Dan threw this together with the idea that the rest of us will engage with it as we will 
Project: Election related Nudge Campaign to intervene in the spread of mis/disinfo
Goals:
Slow the spread
Engage people in the fact that mis/disinfo exists
Present alternatives
Reality Team’s past work
Case 1:
Choose a topic, e.g. Vaccine disinfo
Identify audiences that are particularly vulnerable in that realm
Develop messaging to engage those audiences
Case 2:
Choose an audience (low voter turnout groups in Georgia)
Find out why
Engage them
SFN
Let’s figure out when someone is going to read something false, and distract them
Paper in Nature re: reminding people to think about accuracy does work
Promising things:
Most people don’t intend to spread disinfo
Reminding them, seems to work
Notes:
Effect wasn’t huge, but there are ways to increase it
People going to the daily caller — relatively naive, and truly awful people who are going there for fun/profit/preference
How do we want to define our groups? (e.g. “second quintile”) Who are we intended to move?
“Personas” and “Buyer’s Journey” (both common terms for this, e.g. in design/tech or marketing; where people are in the Sales funnel)
Research question
Where are people on the spectrum and what is their propensity to be pulled in another direction
The Vulnerable: Unable to discern the difference between truth and lies
The Indoctrinated: Have decided and made it part of their identity to believe that stuff
Idea: Industry language vs field language we want to cultivate (SimSec + Reality Team)
To address the problem that funders and policy/advocacy space don’t understand and engage in the marketing terms

Scholarship areas
[Georgia missed something]
Cults
Radicalization
Far right (Europe)
Xenophobia re: Non-white terrorism (US)
Communications interventions to shift behavior
TODO: light lit review-ish
Potential Academic Partners
John Cook(e)? - professor of climate disinformation @ George Mason in the Science Communications
Working with him to discuss Impact Assessment Framework
Can we and in what way can we show changes in perceptions and behaviors as a result of our efforts
Do the share/consume more/less disinfo
Do their beliefs shift at all
Ajay Kumar https://ruralhuman.com/
Idea: Academic Advisory Board for this project
What’s happening right now for SFN?
SimSec (Rina) + Reset (Susana) have team members who are working on the messages
Deliver those messages to the Ad Manager
Ad Manager implements and delivers some “reporting” (See PDF Dan shared)
TT/Combonet is managing the website where people get referred to by the ads (Github + Forestry)
Tech Needs
Could use a 1password account?
techops@reset.tech
Who ever needs to receive verification emails
Someone needs to share with nickb
Throneless can set stuff up using the shared techops accounts
Goal: Accounts that don’t have bus factor of being tied to individuals
Campaign - Where to start?
French election?
Need:
Native french language skills
Insight into the political/social dynamics in France
Can source via Reality Team or SimSec
Replicate German Campaign
Reality Team — Spec out what is needed to replicate German campaign
Analysis of content & campaign (e.g. Facebook)
German nuance & content — SimSec can help

Roles & Responsibilities

Action Items
Pull together all of the docs that have been shared into the Google Drive Folder
Reality Team — Go sketch at what the campaign looks like & tell us what you need
Started a Campaign Sketch


Jul 20, 2021 - Follow-up meeting

​​Agenda
High Level Overview
Tldr: Nudge campaign away from extremist content towards an intervention website, challenging folks to identify the content
What we’re doing here: Syncing around the ways in which Reset/SFNs is currently using nudge tactics to steer people away from disinformation. Hoping to bring Reality Team in to replace the existing ad management partner (who is not politically/ideologically aligned). Long term, using the status quo in the hopes of ultimately dismantling the system. The tactical endeavor is superficial to the ultimate goal of developing understanding and deep critique in order to develop alternate means. 
Band-aid approach; temporary solution while developing methodology for longer-term solutions 
Map out how things work (inputs, outputs, goals, etc) [Notes from miro board]
Each line is a hypothesis
Can’t target specific people, unless you build a custom audience
Targeting is done more in aggregate
Results are harder to track/measure, e.g. if they continue to share fake news
E.g. Facebook will give you the last 3 days of engagement inside Facebook
Can’t get this programmatically
BUT you can get an email report that you could then do something with
Nick: This depends on what link you are dealing with, e.g. your link or something else
DL: One way of doing this is to create a control
E.g. focus on specific common factors, e.g. location & demographics
GB: This is where Rally & Citizen Browser could come in also
Reduction in ability to re-targeting things
We could also make more specific websites about the truthful narratives
Transparency about the process itself
What did we spend
What success did we have
DL: Monthly/Quarterly could work without messing up the study itself
Website - what’s happening / how does it setup?
What are we measuring, e.g. bounce rates
We have Google Analytics
Lots of “Do Not Track” and not consenting
Not delivering the persistent tracker,
Legal review determined that we can still use some GA tracking as essential tracker even without consent because the site isn’t reselling ads
Static sites — not doing anything important
DM: interested in getting smart if we can in some way, e.g. if this then that on the site
E.g. turn it into more of an app
Content - developed & localized by Rina & Susana
Design is intentionally bad / 90s - SFN
DL: Platforms for cross channel ad optimization
Not at the moment, maybe on SPN/Eric’s side
Creating their own dashboard leveraging the facebook email report
We don’t have the report, but Dan found some resources
Questions
How do we measure?
Does it affect elections?
Is it just a money pit?
What is consistent across elections/events?
What is localized?
What are best practices for results?
What standards exist for any of these categories?!
Ideas Going Forward
Article on the difference between band-aid and long term vision
Discussion / writing on consent
SFN/Echtwahr: how do we move beyond basic display ads to something more multiplatform/multimedia (beyond FB/Google ads) 
Narrate it/talk about it so that people can develop a more informed critique 
Evolving what happened in the Netherlands -- measuring whether those efforts actually affected democratic outcomes 
MVP = develop how to use these processes/products and see if we can get to a longer term value proposition 
Pilot project timeline over the next few months
Next steps
More time to dig into Reality Team’s process
Dan share FB report How To — DONE
Note - we already have a pretty sophisticated dashboard of ad metrics. Need to understand what else you’re hoping to get - we do have a wishlist item ourselves.
Dan - contract to fund Reality Team
Josh - lab environment - with  both inoculation messages and oppo messages to discern if inoculation works in that setting.
Grow Progress - low cost lab environment may be interesting to do.  Ulrich Echkert  

Acronym - found boosting news helped.

Majority of their experiments 
Lookalike audiences
Interest based
Self generated custom audiences based on surveys.

Which of FB mechanisms is valid?
In practice, “derived” interests are bad. 
Replaced with “demographic affinity”- which is inaccurate, garbage
Second order
