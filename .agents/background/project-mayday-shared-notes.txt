Mayday Experiments Meeting
Yael Notes in Reset:
YouChoose.ai (Marc & Claudio)
Output Ideas:
Research Paper (sounds like it’d be something public / research publication)
Visualization of the recommendation graph (maybe?)
Something explorable or comparable from some different people’s examples + the objective model
Deb’s note re: potential model for wikipedian-type models for sharing data
e.g. https://www.openhumans.org/
Injecting something into the YT experience
Reality Team / Deb
Reaching Passive Information Consumers (PICs)
“NULL zone” researched by Pew and Knight Foundation
Presentation
Targeting
Randomization — just using birth month to be able to sub group and do some randomization
Looking at nulls (e.g. no news engagement, race = null, etc)
exclusion targeting criteria is cheaper - accidentally finding
Ideas
Languages & geographies
Media Literacy, Advocacy, Journalism are well funded (meh)
But not targeting of specific populations

Outputs
Media clips
Charts
Report
Meta notes:
overlap potential with sponsored content questions on different platforms
Public or not eventually
public outputs — yes, academic papers
parallel in a lab
qualtrix cannot find this audience
Related data sets or panel opportunities…
Rally, Junkipedia, etc
Brain dump for Susan
Mayday is umbrella term (Mayday superpac - exists to counter the existence of PACS)
houses initiatives that shed light on the probelms with the systems
Echt Wahr + Facebook harms - using surveillance capitalism machine to illuminate problems with the surveillance
capitalism machine
Leveraging Mayday as a brand + liability agency (so no one component is harmed)
top priority: report from Echt Wahr is out the door - existing on the mayday site, not connected in brand or name to
any of us
interesting opportunity to be reflective about the ouputs (how to leverage our community + audiences) - we can
talk to our own audiences about the work from our perspective
facebook harms
narratives
mayday strategy - ad campaign driving parents to the site to engage policy making
Engage team at AP tomorrow:
there is a 30 page document in progress; we’ve been talking about ‘how I experience the web today’ site as a
model

Mayday Check-in
Agenda
High Level Overview
Map out how things work (inputs, outputs, goals, etc)
Answer Questions
What is consistent across elections/events?
What is localized?
What are best practices for results?
What standards exist for any of these categories?!

Reality + Reset + SimSec + Throneless
Spotfakenews = testing out nudge theory
Reset Tech | Project Mayday 2
"standard marketing campaign" that's focused on ideas, trying to reroute people from disinformation and
ultimately teach people how to spot fake news and thus avoid and stop spreading it
current partner isn't ideologically aligned long-term
looking for a partner that can replicate the work and be more politically aligned for an ultimate advocacy horizon
advocacy/policy =
reset: larger scale policy shifts that change how companies can access peoples data (?)
more ethical, controlled way for it to be true that everyone's data is exposed (that ship has sailed) —
there are better ways than what we deal with now. be part of the transformation of your field
debra: requires an updated understanding of what "identity"means, because there are aspects that
are outside of our physical person now, and our current conceptions aren't ready to take that into
account
simsec interested in pushing industry to rethink how they practice
public education and resource development
cultural shift opportunity from public awareness
reality:
blown away by how little people know about the surveillance they're subjected to, their willingness to
give data away, etc
building awareness of that is very important first step
deradicalization is a different process than preventing radicalization
understanding where people are on these big sites, and then there's the signal and telegram stuff
that's trying to hide.
theory of change is different trying to get to those two populations
what do we do about harder-to-identify communities? send people in
who to focus on? some people are too far gone to be able to get with the approaches we're talking
about
goals:
Reality
short: ways to use these tools and replicate and combine campaigns to continue feed the beast even further ⟶
model a shift to a better, more ethical way
medium: fun experiments (signal's ig ad campaign). this is a group of people that could figure that out
long: we start winning on policy and advocacy based on the insights of the previous phases, and how to be
move into developing new paradigms
basic goals: deradicalization is preventing further radicalization
primary audience = people who read very little news, but get a lot of disinformation in their feeds, and
believe it bc it's what's in front of them (passive info consumers)
strategy is adding low-intervention, competing information to drown out and draw them away from the
disinformation memes
spotfakenews is further down the funnel (getting the people who are already there, looking at
disinformation) ⟶ the content that reality team makes could be what the people nudged from spotfakenews
could receive next. follow up campaign targeting the people that did engage with SFN and bring people
back to the middle
Reset Tech | Project Mayday 3
marketing funnel that goes in the opposite direction. multiple testing points
phase zero and 1 is replicating this nudge theory with people the platform has already tagged as
engaging
reality has an in-house people buying the ads, getting really good engagement.
in terms of creating thoughtful, "reality's marketing team"
building a marketing funnel going the other way
reality can have managing ad campaigns covered in a fairly cost-effective way
pushed out games, etc — bc getting even a second of someone's attention can introduce ideas and "help
focus their skepticism"
anxiety is often around who to trust
mini-lessons based on propaganda research, but plants a seed
 Mind Games
ultimately trying to solve a problem
not competing with anyone, happy to collaborate and get learning
not looking to make this a financially profitable endeavor beyond being self-sustaining for team members
(not trying to build a kingdom)
happy to iterate on SFN  use it to start to build this funnel (these are the people who aren't really engaged
in radical information, but they're at risk bc theyre too disengaged to know the difference); these are the
people who have clicked on the breitbart link — content to speak engagingly and compassionately to those
people.
adjacent opportunities: not just using CRM methods, but have real people go engage with them.
one of the tools bad actors use is "love bombing" after someone engages with something (positive
affirmations)
opportunity to make those people feel that other people think theyre important and special, build a
community of people who are disinfo detectors, and make them feel reallllly smart and good about
that ("detect info, share credible info)
hire someone to develop that, bc its such an effective thing that bad guys and commercial entities do
that we're not even trying yet
next steps:
Develop the playbook: what tools do we already have?
set up another, longer time to visionboard (miro) and map out the plan and resources needed
Start riffing on and replicating a spotfakenews prototype
