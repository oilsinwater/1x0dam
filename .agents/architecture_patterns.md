# Architecture Patterns

- web: Component-driven SPA/SSR architecture typical of Next.js. Routing via `pages/`, API layer via `lib/` and GROQ fetches. Storybook-backed design system encourages reuse.
- studio: Schema-first content platform using Sanity desk/vision tools; data mutations occur through Sanity’s real-time APIs, making the CMS the system of record.
